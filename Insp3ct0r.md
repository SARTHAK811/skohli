## Walkthrough
To inspect a web code either use Ctrl+Shift+J or right click and select Inspect.
When I inspect the code:
Firstly I see index html file.In the comments i see the part 1 of the flag.
Then I check the css file which shows me second part of the flag .
After that I check the js file which gives me the third part of the flag.
Also as in the name there is 3 and in hints it is mentioned there are three parts of the flag so 
My job is done here :)
